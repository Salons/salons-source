--------------------------------------------------
	We find that discussing ideas in a relaxed social setting is invigorating and fun

Carol and Michael's Salons are salons held periodically in the home of Carol Cooke and Michael Cumming. These salons discuss issues of current interest such as urban living, sustainability and education. Our desire is to keep these salons fun and entertaining and not make them too stuffy or pretentious. 

We initiate a salon by sending out a question to our salon mailing list. This question forms the subject of the salon. We try to keep the salon focused on this, and related questions, but we are not very strict. After the salon is over, we write a short discussion of what happened and the ideas we talked about. These salons and how we structure them is very much a work in progress. 

The first salon occurred 30 November 2013 in East York. We are now planning our second. The salons are currently invitation only. Once we learn more we might open them up to a wider audience.
